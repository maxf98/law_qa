Q&A Guided Legal Document Summarization

Quite often summarization techniques aim to condense textual data to the most vital information. However
the vitalness of the information might depend on the end user in question. In this project we will look at
summarization techniques that are influenced by a user query and should reflect the interest of the user
better.
Additionally to working on general text data this system will be also trained and tested on a corpus of legal
texts with the specific problems and particularities of that domain.

Project outline:

We want to build a text summarization system for the field of Legal Language Processing who will be tasked with summarizing + answering questions about court rulings. For this purpose we will look at summarization techniques utilizing LLM methods and Q&A style interactions afterwards. Our goal is to have this run on our own LLM architecture that is trained on text data from a law context. The system should have a user facing frontend and give a generalized summary + afford the user the possibility to ask questions.

Relevant questions are:

Do we need to fine-tune a model for this task? How is out-of-the-box performance for existing models?
Can we include more text as background knowledge such as actual written law that is related to the subjects of the court rulings?
Are there any projects (likely from industry) that try to tackle these summaries specifically?

Getting started:

Look up possible data sets of court rulings (there are many).
Check relevant literature on legal language processing from the last 12 month (ex. NLLP Workshop)
Try to "solve" the task with an existing model (such as GPT-4) and look up open source models we could run and try the same thing on.
Datasets for benchmarking summarization and Q&A for the legal field?
Look for existing systems without a legal focus and how they approach things.
